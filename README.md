## About 
<p align ="justify">
  This project was made for the 2021 <a href="https://hackapalooza.dev" target="_blank">Hackapalooza</a> Hackathon. (Winner of the Best Beginner Hack prize).   
"memebreak" aims to distract you while you are working, ruin your productivity, and give you much needed breaks in lengthy computer sessions with memes which open up in a new window after a specified time! However, we do respect important meetings and have implemented a system to delay a meme by up to 1 hour because a meeting longer than that isn't worth going to without memes! On that note, let's talk about the memes, the memes are sourced from <a href="https://reddit.com">Reddit</a> and are filtered to exclude any Not Safe For Work(NSFW) posts. There is even a NEXT feauture with which you can get lost in a never ending world of instant gratification!
